Information
===========

This is the PASCAL3D+ benchmark [1] for 3D object detection and pose estimation.
We augments 12 rigid categories of the PASCAL VOC 2012 [2] with 3D annotations.
Furthermore, more images are added to each category from ImageNet [3].
The annotations are in the .mat format of MATLAB.

For questions concerning the benchmark, please contact Yu Xiang at
<yuxiang AT umich DOT edu>.

This project has been supported by ONR grant N00014-13-1-0761 and NFS CAREER
grant #1054127.

Basic Usage
===========

There are 9 directories in this package:

1. Anchor. Anchor points/landmarks of the 12 categories in .off format.
2. Annotations. The augmented PASCAL and ImageNet annotations for the 12 categories.
3. Annotation_tools. The annotation tools for bounding box and 3D annotation, and some scripts to visualize the annotations.
                     The scripts are helpful to understand the format of the annotation.
4. CAD. The CAD models used in the annotations both in .off and .mat formats.
5. Images. The PASCAL and ImageNet images of the 12 categories.
6. Image_sets. Separation of the ImageNet images into training and validation sets, and subtype names for each category.
7. PASCAL. The original PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark.
8. Segmentation. Code for projecting CAD models using annotations to obtain the segmentation masks of objects.
9. VDPM. Modified DPM [4] code for joint detection and pose estimation. The data directory contains our trained models and test results.
         The entry functions for training and testing are pose_train.m and pose_test.m respectively.
         The evaluation function is compute_recall_precision_accuracy.m.
